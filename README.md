# Dice-Roller
a very simple python program for rolling dice.

## Dice Rolling Simulator

As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. It will generate a random number each time the program runs. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice). 

The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. The program should take a argument on how many dice to roll. (roll 3) might produce 2, 5, 1; roll by itself goes into the loop.
